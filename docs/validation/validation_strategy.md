# BioEq Validation Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the validation strategy for the BioEq package, designed to ensure compliance with FDA requirements for software used in bioequivalence studies. The goal is to establish that BioEq provides accurate, reliable, and reproducible results suitable for regulatory submissions.

## Regulatory Framework

BioEq's validation approach is designed to align with FDA guidance, including:

- 21 CFR Part 11 (Electronic Records and Electronic Signatures)
- FDA Guidance for Industry: Statistical Approaches to Establishing Bioequivalence
- GAMP 5 principles for pharmaceutical software validation

## Validation Components

### 1. Requirements Specification

A detailed requirements document specifies all functional requirements, including:
- Calculation methods for PK parameters (AUC, Cmax, Tmax, etc.)
- Statistical analysis capabilities (ANOVA, mixed effects models)
- Data input/output requirements
- Reporting capabilities

### 2. Design Specification

Documentation of architecture, modules, and algorithms, including detailed descriptions of statistical methods and their implementation.

### 3. Code Documentation

Comprehensive docstrings and comments explaining the implementation of each algorithm, with references to established statistical methods.

### 4. Test Strategy

A multi-tiered testing approach:
- Unit testing of individual functions
- Integration testing of component interactions
- System testing of complete workflows
- Validation testing against known results and reference implementations

### 5. Performance Qualification

Verification that BioEq produces results equivalent to established methods, including:
- Comparison with reference datasets
- Statistical equivalence testing
- Boundary and edge case testing

### 6. Traceability

Mappings that demonstrate how each requirement is implemented in code and verified by tests.

### 7. Change Control

Procedures for managing changes to ensure continued validity through versioning.

## Validation Activities

### Algorithmic Verification

For each analytical method, we provide:
1. Mathematical basis with references to established literature
2. Step-by-step calculation descriptions
3. Verification against manually calculated results or reference implementations

### Test Suite

Comprehensive tests verify:
- Accuracy of PK parameter calculations
- Correct implementation of statistical models
- Proper handling of edge cases and error conditions
- Consistency across different data structures and formats

### Documentation Package

- User manual with detailed methodology descriptions
- Technical documentation with algorithm specifications
- Example workflows demonstrating proper use
- Validation reports summarizing test results

## SAS Equivalence (Future)

The long-term validation plan includes:
- Comparative testing against identical analyses in SAS
- Documentation of numerical equivalence for key outputs
- Identification and explanation of any discrepancies

This document will evolve as validation activities progress.
