# BioEq Functional Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction

This document specifies the functional requirements for the BioEq software package, designed for analyzing bioequivalence studies. These requirements are aligned with FDA guidance for statistical approaches to establishing bioequivalence.

## 2. Pharmacokinetic Parameter Calculation Requirements

### 2.1 Area Under the Curve (AUC)

FR-2.1.1: The system shall calculate AUC using the trapezoidal rule.  
FR-2.1.2: The system shall handle non-uniform time points.  
FR-2.1.3: The system shall calculate AUC from time zero to the last measured time point (AUC₀-ₜ).  
FR-2.1.4: The system shall calculate AUC extrapolated to infinity (AUC₀-∞) using the terminal elimination rate constant.  
FR-2.1.5: The system shall report the percentage of AUC extrapolated beyond the last time point.  

### 2.2 Maximum Concentration (Cmax)

FR-2.2.1: The system shall determine the maximum observed concentration.  
FR-2.2.2: The system shall identify the time point at which Cmax occurs (Tmax).  

### 2.3 Elimination Parameters

FR-2.3.1: The system shall calculate the terminal elimination rate constant (λz) using log-linear regression.  
FR-2.3.2: The system shall calculate the elimination half-life (t½) as ln(2)/λz.  
FR-2.3.3: The system shall provide criteria for selecting points for the terminal elimination phase.  

## 3. Statistical Analysis Requirements

### 3.1 Crossover Design Analysis

FR-3.1.1: The system shall perform ANOVA for 2×2 crossover designs.  
FR-3.1.2: The system shall include sequence, period, and treatment effects in the ANOVA model.  
FR-3.1.3: The system shall calculate least-squares means for test and reference treatments.  
FR-3.1.4: The system shall implement mixed-effects models with subject as a random effect.  

### 3.2 Parallel Design Analysis

FR-3.2.1: The system shall perform t-tests comparing test and reference groups.  
FR-3.2.2: The system shall perform ANOVA with treatment as the only factor.  

### 3.3 Bioequivalence Assessment

FR-3.3.1: The system shall calculate point estimates for the Test/Reference ratio.  
FR-3.3.2: The system shall calculate 90% confidence intervals for bioequivalence assessment.  
FR-3.3.3: The system shall assess whether the calculated intervals fall within the 80-125% bioequivalence limits.  
FR-3.3.4: The system shall perform analyses on log-transformed PK parameters.  

## 4. Data Management Requirements

FR-4.1: The system shall accept data in standardized formats (CSV, Excel).  
FR-4.2: The system shall validate input data for completeness and consistency.  
FR-4.3: The system shall handle missing data appropriately.  
FR-4.4: The system shall provide data summary statistics by treatment group.  

## 5. Reporting Requirements

FR-5.1: The system shall generate summary tables of PK parameters.  
FR-5.2: The system shall produce statistical output in a format similar to established software.  
FR-5.3: The system shall enable export of results to standard formats.  
FR-5.4: The system shall provide measures of variability (SD, CV%) for all parameters.  

## 6. Validation Requirements

FR-6.1: The system shall provide detailed documentation of all calculation methods.  
FR-6.2: The system shall include references to established literature for all implemented methods.  
FR-6.3: The system shall maintain traceability between requirements and implementation.  
FR-6.4: The system shall include comprehensive test coverage for all calculations.  

## 7. Quality Control Requirements

FR-7.1: The system shall produce consistent results for identical inputs.  
FR-7.2: The system shall maintain precision in calculations to minimize rounding errors.  
FR-7.3: The system shall validate inputs and provide appropriate error messages.  
FR-7.4: The system shall maintain an audit trail of analysis steps.  

This requirements specification will serve as the foundation for development, testing, and validation of the BioEq package.
