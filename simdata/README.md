## Datasets

- **`be_R_package_simdata.csv`**
  Simulation data provided by Sungpil Han, who developed an R package for bioequivalence (BE).

- **`adpp.sas7bdat`**
  Deidentified SAS data from a contact with pharmacokinetics expertise.

- **`bioeq_simdata_1.csv`**
  Locally generated data created with `bioeq_simdata_1.py`.

- **`bioeq_simdata_2.csv`**
  CSV version of `adpp.sas7bdat`.

- **`testdata.csv`**
  Simulation data from someone else's project: <https://github.com/statist-bhfz/bioeq/blob/master/testdata.csv>

---

## Scripts

- **`bioeq_simdata_1.py`**
  Generates simulation data for bioequivalence calculations in phase I clinical trials.
